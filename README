# QAD3T - Quick and Dirty Touch Type Trainer

QAD3T is a quick and dirty touch type trainer intended for those trying to learn touch typing (such as myself).

It tries to understand what characters are confused with each other and then tries to focus on those characters, along with those that are typed the slowest.

The goal is to be as feature complete as possible while still fitting in a few hundered lines of code.

## Usage

Just run it with python.
